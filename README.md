## Abstract
In this project, I address some of the key observations and results that I noticed. The focus of this study is two-fold; the first objective is using a job search platform to extract information about the job descriptions and qualifications. Since some job titles are often used interchangeably in the job market, the roles also overlap. Therefore, by analyzing these previously collected information, I identify some of the distinct properties that could potentially behave as key indicators for the given job title. The second objective is testing the performance power of Information Retrieval (IR) utilizing the dataset that's been created. I study whether using job titles as queries are nice measurement tools to help guide users find relevant information they need.
